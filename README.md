# 100websites 

My plan is to practice by making 100 websites.

I have used:

Skeleton boilerplate - great for small projects

Bootstrap - awesome and responsive framework

fullPage.js - fullscreen scrolls, creative https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/

Superslides - https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides

Typed JS - https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/

Owl carousel - https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/
